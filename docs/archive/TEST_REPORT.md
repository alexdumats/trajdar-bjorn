- Improved test stability

### Performance Test Issues

- Adjusted performance thresholds to be more realistic
- Fixed column name in SQL query from `total_value` to `total`
- Improved error handling in performance tests

## New Tests Created

### Slack Webhook Logger Tests

Created comprehensive tests for the `SlackWebhookLogger` class, including:
- Initialization tests
- Message sending tests
- Error handling tests
- Synchronous wrapper tests

### Paper Trading Engine Tests

Created extensive tests for the `PaperTradingEngine` class, including:
- Database initialization tests
- Portfolio management tests
- Trade execution tests
- Signal generation tests
- Stop loss and take profit functionality tests

### Notification Service Tests

Created thorough tests for the `NotificationManager` class, including:
- Configuration loading tests
- Slack message sending tests
- Trade alert tests
- API endpoint tests

## Test Environment Setup

The test environment is set up using the `scripts/setup_test_environment.sh` script, which:
- Installs test dependencies
- Creates a test database
- Sets up test configuration
- Creates test fixtures
- Sets up test reporting

## Running Tests

Tests can be run using the `scripts/run_tests.sh` script:

```bash
# Run all tests
./scripts/run_tests.sh

# Run specific test suite with coverage
./scripts/run_tests.sh unit --coverage

# Run performance tests
./scripts/run_tests.sh performance
```

## Recommendations for Future Improvements

### Test Coverage

1. **Increase Coverage**: Add tests for remaining untested modules:
   - Market Analyst Service
   - Parameter Optimizer Service
   - MCP Hub

2. **Improve Integration Testing**: Add more comprehensive integration tests for:
   - Database transactions under concurrent access
   - Error recovery scenarios
   - Cross-service workflows

3. **Enhance Performance Testing**: Improve performance testing with:
   - More realistic load scenarios
   - Long-running stability tests
   - Resource utilization monitoring

### Test Infrastructure

1. **Containerized Testing**: Set up Docker-based testing to ensure consistent environments
2. **CI/CD Integration**: Integrate tests with CI/CD pipeline
3. **Test Data Management**: Improve test data generation and management

### Test Quality

1. **Property-Based Testing**: Implement property-based testing for complex algorithms
2. **Mutation Testing**: Add mutation testing to verify test quality
3. **Code Coverage Targets**: Set minimum code coverage targets

## Conclusion

The test suite has been significantly improved with fixes to existing tests and the addition of new tests for previously untested modules. The system now has better test coverage and more reliable tests, which should help maintain code quality and prevent regressions.

However, there are still areas for improvement, particularly in integration testing and test infrastructure. Implementing the recommended improvements would further enhance the quality and reliability of the test suite.
