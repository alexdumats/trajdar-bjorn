- Log restart intention in system event log
- Set system status to "Preparing for Restart"

### 2. Data Preservation Phase
- Pause all active calculations and analyses
- Complete any in-progress database transactions
- Flush in-memory data to persistent storage
- Create snapshot of current system state
- Verify snapshot integrity

### 3. Service Shutdown Phase
- Gracefully terminate connections to MCP servers
- Close database connections
- Stop all background tasks and workers
- Set system status to "Shutting Down"

## Post-Restart Integrity Verification Protocol

### 1. Service Startup Phase
- Initialize core system components
- Establish database connections
- Set system status to "Starting Up"

### 2. Integrity Verification Phase
- Load system state snapshot
- Verify database connectivity and integrity
- Check file system access and permissions
- Validate configuration settings
- Test MCP server connections

### 3. Service Restoration Phase
- Resume scheduled tasks and background workers
- Process any queued operations
- Set system status to "Operational"
- Send notification of successful restart

## Troubleshooting Procedures

### Database Connection Issues

#### Symptoms
- Error logs showing database connection failures
- Timeout errors when retrieving trade data
- Incomplete or missing data in reports

#### Diagnostic Steps
1. Check database server status and connectivity
2. Verify database credentials and permissions
3. Examine database server logs for errors
4. Test connection with minimal query
5. Check for database locks or long-running queries

#### Resolution Steps
1. Restart database connection pool
2. If persistent, restart database service
3. Restore from backup if corruption detected
4. Update connection parameters if needed
5. Implement connection retry with exponential backoff

### MCP Server Communication Failures

#### Symptoms
- Timeout errors when calling MCP server endpoints
- Missing research data or notifications
- Incomplete insights in reports

#### Diagnostic Steps
1. Verify network connectivity to MCP server
2. Check MCP server status and health
3. Examine request logs for error patterns
4. Test basic endpoint connectivity
5. Verify authentication credentials

#### Resolution Steps
1. Implement retry mechanism for transient failures
2. Update MCP server connection parameters
3. Restart MCP server if accessible
4. Switch to backup MCP server if available
5. Degrade gracefully if service remains unavailable

### Report Generation Failures

#### Symptoms
- Incomplete or corrupted reports
- Error messages during report generation
- Missing data in generated reports

#### Diagnostic Steps
1. Check for sufficient disk space
2. Verify file system permissions
3. Examine report generation logs
4. Test with minimal dataset
5. Verify template integrity

#### Resolution Steps
1. Clear temporary files and retry
2. Update report templates if corrupted
3. Generate report with reduced dataset
4. Restore templates from backup if needed
5. Update file system permissions if required

### Memory Management Issues

#### Symptoms
- System slowdowns during analysis
- Out of memory errors
- Unexpected process termination

#### Diagnostic Steps
1. Monitor memory usage patterns
